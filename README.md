Recommendation-system-using-Lucene

I have implemented a content-based recommender via an web app by recommending similarity-based Java programming wikibooks content for Stackoverflow.com data set. (Team Project)

Below are the tasks performed:

Crawled java programming wikibooks pages
Used Apache Lucene to index the crawled content
Built a simple web app to display the provided StackOverflow 10 posts.
Listed the top 10 relevant wikibooks items (from the indexed documents).
