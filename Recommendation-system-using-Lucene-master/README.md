# Recommendation-system-using-Lucene

I have implemented a content-based recommender via an web app by recommending similarity-based Java programming wikibooks content for
Stackoverflow.com data set.

Below are the tasks performed:
1. Crawled java programming wikibooks pages
2. Used Apache Lucene to index the crawled content
3. Built a simple web app to display the provided StackOverflow 10 posts.
4. Listed the top 10 relevant wikibooks items (from the indexed documents).
