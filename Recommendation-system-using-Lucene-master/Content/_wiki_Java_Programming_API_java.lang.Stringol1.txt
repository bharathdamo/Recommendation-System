"Foo Bar Bam Baz "We only process non null strings,
We first split the mail into two parts to separate the personal information from the company information and we keep the name data,
Then we split the name information to separate the first name from the last name. As the split() method use regular expression and . is a wildcard character, we have to escape it (\.). However, in a string, the \ is also a special character, so we need to escape it too (\\.),
The last name is just capitalized,
As the case of all the first name characters will not be the same, we have to cut the first name. Only the first name initial will be capitalized,
Now we can concatenate all the fragments. We prefer to use a StringBuilder to do that.
