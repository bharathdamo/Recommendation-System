If a member is annotated with a type itself marked as @Documented, then that member will be documented as annotating that type.
In the documentation for the Example class, such as the JavaDoc, Example will be shown as annotated with @NotSecret, but not @Secret.

Exactly as the name sounds, an @Inherited annotation type is inherited by subclasses of an annotated type.
In this example, Superclass has been explicitly annotated with both @ForEveryone and @JustForMe. Subclass hasn't been explicitly marked with either one; however, it inherits @ForEveryone because the latter is annotated with @Inherited. @JustForMe isn't annotated, so it isn't inherited by Subclass.
A @Repeatable annotation type is repeatable - i.e. can be specified multiple times on the same class. This meta-annotation was added in Java 8.
Different annotation types have different purposes. Some are intended for use with the compiler; others are meant to be reflected dynamically at runtime. There's no reason for a compiler annotation to be available at runtime, so the @Retention meta-annotation specifies how long an annotation type should be retained. The value attribute is one of the java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy enum constants. The possible values, in order from shortest to longest retention, are as follows:
If no @Retention policy is specified, it defaults to RetentionPolicy.CLASS.
The @Target meta-annotation determines what may be marked by the annotation. The value attribute is one or more of the java.lang.annotation.ElementType enum constants. Those constants are ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, CONSTRUCTOR, FIELD, LOCAL_VARIABLE, METHOD, PACKAGE, PARAMETER, and TYPE.
If @Target is not specified, the annotation may be used on any program element.
