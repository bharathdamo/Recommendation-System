The totality of the components is put in a border layout so that we have three vertical areas of elements.
The area in the north is the area of the title.
The area in the center contains the buttons and the folders and will be split later.
The area in the south is the area of the status bar.
The area in the center is now split with a border layout into a button area in the center and a folder area in the south.
The button area is then split with a flow layout.
The folder area is now split with a grid layout.
